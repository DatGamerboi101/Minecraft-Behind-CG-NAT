# Minecraft-Behind-CG-NAT

This document aims toward setting up a Minecraft server behind CG-NAT (Carrier Grade NAT) which can prevent users outside your network form accessing any service that’s hosted in it.

# What is CG-NAT?

CG-NAT aka “Carrier Grade - Network Adress translation” and is often for residential use  and to prevent IPv4 Exhaustion by adding a second layer of NAT. That means it’s not possible to access any services that you host on your Local Network.

# Bypass CG-NAT (not open sourced)

There are plenty of different ways to bypass CG-NAT but not everything is for free. There are services such as [playit.gg](https://playit.gg/) and [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), both offer a free plan but are pretty limited like limited bandwidth and no custom domains. If you don’t worry about bandwidths and custom domains so are they are viable choice.

These services creates a Secure tunnel between your Minecraft Server and their relay servers what other users connect to and then gets routed through the tunnel to your server.

But if you’re looking for a completely self hosted and open source solution you,  check out [[Minecraft Server behind CG-NAT#How to bypass CG-NAT | How to bypass CG-NAT]].

## How to bypass CG-NAT

To bypass CG-NAT you’ll Need a Minecraft server and a VPS with a public IP and docker on both servers. You can use any VPS provider like [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) or Hetzner.

To get it working we need to use [rathole](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole) which is a open source project for self hosted tunnel. But the official docker image only supports ``amd64`` so we need a fork of it by [archef2000](https://hub.docker.com/r/archef2000/rathole) which supports ``arm64`` (For arm based systems)

# Installation with docker

Make sure both ``docker`` and ``docker-compose`` commands work before continuing. With the help of [archef2000’s](https://hub.docker.com/r/archef2000/rathole) fork and docker-compose it can be easily deployed.

>[!caution] 
>**Never** share or use simple tokens in `SERVICE_TOKEN_X=TOKEN_HERE` . It might be subjected to a brute force attack and risk compromising the tunnel.

You can find ``docker-compose`` examples below for both ``client`` and ``server``

## Docker-compose ``Server``

### ``docker-compose`` for vanilla server

```d
version: '1.0'
services:
  rathole-server:
    image: archef2000/rathole:latest
    container_name: rathole
    environment:
      - "RUST_LOG=info"
      - "ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:2333"
      - "SERVICE_TOKEN_1=TOKEN_1"
      - "SERVICE_NAME_1=minecraft"
      - "SERVICE_ADDRESS_1=0.0.0.0:25565"
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
```

### ``docker-compose`` for use with Simple Voice mod

```d
version: '1.0'
services:
  rathole-server:
    image: archef2000/rathole:latest
    container_name: rathole
    environment:
      - "RUST_LOG=info"
      - "ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:2333"
      - "SERVICE_TOKEN_1=TOKEN_1"
      - "SERVICE_TOKEN_2=TOKEN_2"
      - "SERVICE_NAME_1=minecraft"
      - "SERVICE_NAME_2=voicechat"
      - "SERVICE_TYPE_2=udp"
      - "SERVICE_ADDRESS_1=0.0.0.0:25565"
      - "SERVICE_ADDRESS_2=0.0.0.0:24454"
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
```

>[!note]
>Simple voice mod uses``port:24454`` by default and ``UDP`` so it’s important to specify it with `SERVICE_TYPE_2=udp` 

## Docker-compose ``Client``

### ``docker-compose`` for vanilla server

```d
version: '1.0'
services:
  rathole-client:
    image: archef2000/rathole:latest
    command: client
    environment:
      - "RUST_LOG=info"
      - "ADDRESS=IP_OF_SERVER:2333"
      - "SERVICE_TOKEN_1=TOKEN_1"
      - "SERVICE_NAME_1=minecraft"
      - "SERVICE_ADDRESS_1=IP_OF_HOST:25565"
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
```

### ``docker-compose`` for use with Simple Voice mod

```d
version: '1.0'
services:
  rathole-client:
    image: archef2000/rathole:latest
    command: client
    environment:
      - "RUST_LOG=info"
      - "ADDRESS=IP_OF_SERVER:2333"
      - "SERVICE_TOKEN_1=TOKEN_1"
      - "SERVICE_TOKEN_2=TOKEN_2"
      - "SERVICE_NAME_1=minecraft"
      - "SERVICE_NAME_2=voicechat"
      - "SERVICE_TYPE_2=udp"
      - "SERVICE_ADDRESS_1=IP_OF_HOST:25565"
      - "SERVICE_ADDRESS_2=IP_OF_HOST:24454"
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
```
